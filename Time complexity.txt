Time complexity - The code takes time to show result i.r the time gap between request and response.

To show time complexity we use Big O notation.

O(n) - no fixed size of data structure 
O(n2) square - Nested loops with no fixed size

Optimal code - O(n) and 
O(log n) - array is reducing in half- again half eg. binary search


O(n log n) - Searching O(n) + binary search O(log n) = Merge sort


check time complexity for programs.

Use of TC - simple logic with less time complexity.
Everyone can be a programmar but everyone can not be a good programmer.
